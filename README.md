Current Status:
The repository has been created, but the README.md file is currently empty and no project files have been added yet. Only the repository structure exists at this stage.
The next step will be adding the initial project files, followed by completing the README with full project documentation.

Planned README Contents (To Be Added Soon):
Introduction to the Student Management System
List of main features (MVP + stretch)
Class descriptions (Student and StudentManager)
Instructions for compiling and running
Folder structure
UML class diagram
Team responsibilities
Timeline and milestones

These sections will be added as development progresses.
